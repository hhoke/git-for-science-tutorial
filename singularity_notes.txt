Workflow:
Build on a machine where you have root privileges.

`sudo singularity build myimg.simg Singularity_file`

Singularity for Mac is probably a few months away. Right now you have to use a virtual machine.

Alternatively, pull down from docker hub as a regular user:

`myUserName@ncflogin5: singularity build centos7.simg docker://centos:7`

Run anywhere you can log in, as that user.

`singularity exec -B ${DATA_DIR}:/data -B ${CODE_DIR}:/code myimg.simg /code/scripts/run.sh /data/myThing $http_proxy $https_proxy $no_proxy`

Make sure to bind the directories you will need (and only the directories you need).
